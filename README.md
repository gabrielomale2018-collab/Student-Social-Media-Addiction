## RECOMMENDATIONS:

##### 2.	The school should also introduce digital wellness or workshops specifically for undergraduates, and emphasize on their healthy boundaries around social media.
##### 3.	Teaching the risks of apps like Instagram, TikTok, & Snapchat. Educate them about the side effects of these apps and encourage mindful usage of them.
##### 4.	The school should also form peer group discussion where students can talk openly about their digital habits, share tips, and support one another in cutting down screen time. 

## CONCLUSION:
##### This data reveals a clear relationship between social media usage and student wellness. While social platforms are crucial part of student life, moderation and mindfulness are key to maintaining healthy academic and personal outcomes …..
